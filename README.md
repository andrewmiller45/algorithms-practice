# algorithms-practice

- A repository of my daily technical challenge work.
- Some answers have been through a course through Udemy working on spicier algorithm problems.
- All CodeWars answers are done without assistance and some likely could be refactored.


# constraints 
- I try and allot 45 minutes for pseudocoding and implementation of answers
- If my time ends early, I will then seek out help. 
- I try to minimize my use of MDN but will if I find I am taking too long!
